    <h1>Quiche Recipe</h1>
    <p>Here we have yet again, another childhood favorite! This meal 
        is super convenient to make as a college student because I 
        can cook it up like a pie, slice it into pieces, and save it for 
        different breakfeast's throughout the week. It's cost effective 
        and delicious!

    </p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <li>10 ounces frozen chopped spinach</li>
      <li>1 refrigerated pie crust</li>
      <li>5 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon gound nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup diced cooked ham</li>
      <li>3/4 cip 1/4 inch diced melty cheese (Gruyere orwhite cheddar)</li>
      <li>2 green onions (finely chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol><h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. If your frozen spinach is not
          already thawed, thaw it in the microwave per the directions. 
          Place the spinach in a colander and squeeze out as much liquid
          as possible. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Blind Bake the Crust (If your crust comes pre-formed in a 
          disposable pan). Place the pie dish on a baking sheet and 
          bake for 3 minutes. Remove it from the oven, prick it all 
          over with the tines of a fork, then return to the oven and
          bake until light golden, about 10 minutes more. Reduce the 
          oven temperature to 350 degrees F. See notes if you use a 
          pie dough sheet or make your own dough.**</li>
      <li>Prepare the Filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 
          the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and Tabasco.</li>
      <li>Squeeze and blot more water out of the spinach 
          (you want it as dry as possible), then scatter 
          it evenly over the bottom of the blind-baked crust.
           Sprinkle the ham, cheese, and onion over the 
           top of the spinach.</li>
      <li>Carefully pour the egg mixture over the top.</li>
      <li>Bake the Quiche: Bake the quiche on the baking sheet, 
          until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge of the crust
           comes out clean and the center is set, about 40 to 50 
           minutes. If at any point the crust begins to brown more 
           than you would like, protect it with foil or a pie crust 
           shield. Let the baked quiche rest for 5 to 10 minutes, 
           then slice and serve.</li>
