    <h1>Burrito Bowl</h1>
    <p>Ahhh... yes... Burrito Bowl. My mom used to make this for me
        all the time and I have to say it's likely one of my favorite dishes of
        all time! </p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
          <li>4 cups of cooked rice ($0.99)</li>
          <li>1 lb. ground turkey or beef ($3.99)</li>
          <li>taco seasoning* ($0.67)</li>
          <li>1 cup of frozen corn kernels ($.38)</li>
          <li>1 15oz. can of black beans ($0.59)</li>
          <li>4 oz. cheese (about 1 cup shredded) ($1.00)</li>
          <li>1 1/3 cup salsa ($1.30)</li>
          <li>2 green onions ($0.13)</li>
        </ul>


    <ol><h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <li>Cook the rice first. 
            You will be able to prepare all the rest of the ingredients
            as the rice cooks. Cook the rice according to the package
            directions. To yield about 4 cups white rice, I use 1.5 
            cups uncooked rice and 2.5 cups water, but this may vary
            depending on your rice variety, so be sure to check the
            package.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, add the ground turkey or 
            beef to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it
            is cooked through. Depending on the fat content of
            your meat, you may need to add a little oil to the
            skillet to keep it from sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is fully cooked, add the taco 
            seasoning and 1/2 cup water. Stir and simmer 
            the meat and spices until the water reduces 
            to a saucy consistency (about 5 minutes). Turn 
            the heat off and set the meat aside.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is fully cooked, add the taco seasoning 
            and 1/2 cup water. Stir and simmer the meat and spices 
            until the water reduces to a saucy consistency 
            (about 5 minutes). Turn the heat off and set the meat aside.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is finished, fluff it with a fork and divide 
            it between four containers. Divide the remaining six bowl 
            ingredients between the containers as well (taco meat, corn,
            beans, cheese, salsa, and green onions). </li>
        <li>Reheat the bowls for 1-2 minutes before eating to melt the 
            cheese and heat the meat and rice through.</li>
    </ol>
